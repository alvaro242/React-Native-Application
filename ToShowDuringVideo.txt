we´ve got basically a combination of stack and tab navigation. Most of the screens are on stack but the 5 main ones are on tab navigation
RefreshControl Web
Contacts is basicaly a flatlist of contacts that came from API
All API calls are triggered from API component
Validation with yup and formik
Only changed properties send to API
I dind´t think it makes sense to update password in the same screenwith the same button so I created another view for that which includes again formik and yup validation but uses the same amend contact details function from my API component 

icons imported from MaterialIcons , verify 
compared response from API with my current contacts to only show the ones available to add
I really wanted to show the pics for each member so I made a loop to first obtain the pictures of all the members. Then I obtained the chat info from the API and created and conbimed array with pictures and details that I displayed on the flatlist
total of messages is just the lenght of the array 
ChatScreen - loading the conversation. For the style I created a function that checks if the current user was the author to apply one style or the othefa-rotate-180
I imported a menu from a framework called react paper. 
Then I play a bit with the states so on Amend tap an invisible amend container appears with the content of the message. This disappears after I press the X or Amend
The time of the last message is quite cool as I made a function to convert the timestamp a date and it returns a different thing depending on that time being more than 7 days ago, within this week or within this day.
